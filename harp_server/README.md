# HARP sweep server — the generate phase as many TAPIS jobs

The original generate phase runs a whole Cheetah campaign inside **one**
container, so one TAPIS job runs every sweep combination on one machine.
The sweep server splits the sweep into **many TAPIS jobs**, spreads them across
several execution systems (different hardware), follows them until they all end,
and merges the profiling CSVs into one file in a storage location you choose in
the UI. The server reaches every system and file through TAPIS
(Systems, Files, Apps and Jobs). It never touches a cluster file system
directly.

## Pieces

| Path | What it does |
|---|---|
| `harp_server/plan.py` | Turns the profiling page's plan into sweeps. Reads each app's command and parameters from its TAPIS notes, fills in each job's hardware from the queue (cores = queue max, 4 GB per core, runs × timeout + 10 min, 1 node, `--nv` on GPU queues, per-queue job limit shared between configurations) and refuses anything over the queue's TAPIS limits. |
| `harp_server/sweep.py` | Validates the spec, expands every parameter combination (SD / FS / test_data) and splits it into jobs. **split** spreads the jobs round-robin over the systems (by weight). **replicate** runs every job on every system so you can profile across hardware. |
| `harp_server/campaign.py` | Submits jobs without exceeding each system's *max concurrent jobs*, polls TAPIS for job status, reads each running job's progress through TAPIS Files, merges the CSVs when every job has ended, and lets you cancel a sweep. Each campaign's state is saved as a JSON file, so it survives a server restart. |
| `harp_server/tapis_gateway.py` | The only code that talks to TAPIS (tapipy): login, systems and queues, apps, files, jobs. |
| `harp_server/app.py` | The REST API, and serves `profiling.html` (the UI) at `/`. |
| `../job_runner/harp_job_runner.py` | Runs inside each job's container. It executes its combinations × repetitions, measures walltime and hardware, and writes `harp_profile.csv` to the TAPIS output directory. |

The merged CSV has the same columns as `Post_Execution_Scripts/basic/DataScrapper.py`
(`run_config, run_type, sys_*, run_<param>, walltime`). It is named `<application>_<timestamp>.csv`,
which is the name the existing **build** phase looks for. Runs that fail go to
`harp_failures.csv` instead, so they never pollute the training data. A
`manifest.json` lists every job with its TAPIS UUID, system and status.

## Setup

1. **Build and push the job container** for your application (from the repo root):
   ```bash
   docker build -f DockerFiles/Dockerfile_App_EulerNumber_Sweep -t <hub>/harp-sweep-eulernumber:1.0.0 .
   docker push <hub>/harp-sweep-eulernumber:1.0.0
   ```
   For your own application, start from `DockerFiles/Dockerfile_App_Template_Sweep`.
2. **Register the TAPIS app** with `Notebooks/Create_HARP_Sweep_App_TAPIS.ipynb` (tapipy). It
   creates the app, or updates it if it already exists, and can run one small test job. The GitHub
   workflow `.github/workflows/build-sweep-image.yml` builds and pushes the image to
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/harp-sweep-eulernumber:1.0.0`, so you don't need Docker locally. Make that
   package public once so the clusters can pull it.
3. **Register the systems and credentials** as in `Notebooks/Executing_HARP_using_TAPIS*.ipynb`.
4. **Just for you, on your laptop (macOS or Linux):** you need Python 3.11 or 3.12 and this repository.
   ```bash
   ./harp_server/scripts/run_local.sh      # first run installs fastapi, uvicorn and tapipy into harp_server/.venv
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:8000`. It listens on this machine only, so plain http is fine. Keep the laptop awake
   while sweeps run (e.g. `caffeinate -i ./harp_server/scripts/run_local.sh` on a Mac); if it sleeps or you stop
   the server, the jobs already in TAPIS keep running, and after you start it again and log in, the server
   picks the sweeps back up. State is kept in `~/.harp_server`.

5. **For other people, run the server over HTTPS** (it receives TAPIS access tokens, so it must use HTTPS):
   ```bash
   pip install -r harp_server/requirements.txt
   cd harp_server
   # testing only: a self-signed certificate (browsers will show a warning)
   ./scripts/make_dev_cert.sh certs <server-hostname>
   HARP_SSL_CERT=certs/cert.pem HARP_SSL_KEY=certs/key.pem python3 -m harp_server.serve
   ```
   Open `https://<server-hostname>:8443`. For a server other people use, get a real
   certificate (from your institution or Let's Encrypt) and point `HARP_SSL_CERT` / `HARP_SSL_KEY`
   at it. If HTTPS is handled by nginx, Caddy or Apache in front of the server, run
   `HARP_BEHIND_PROXY=1 HARP_PORT=8000 python3 -m harp_server.serve` and have the proxy forward
   to port 8000 with an `X-Forwarded-Proto` header.

   The server refuses logins over plain `http://` except from `localhost` (for development).
   Responses carry HSTS, a strict Content-Security-Policy and no-store caching for the API.

   Environment variables:
   - `HARP_SSL_CERT`, `HARP_SSL_KEY`: certificate and key (PEM).
   - `HARP_HOST`, `HARP_PORT`: address to listen on. Default `0.0.0.0:8443`.
   - `HARP_ALLOW_HTTP=1`: accept logins over plain HTTP. Never use this on a shared server.
   - `HARP_SERVER_DATA`: where campaign state is kept. Default `~/.harp_server`.
   - `HARP_POLL_SECONDS`: how often the server polls TAPIS. Default `15`.
   - `HARP_TAPIS_BASE_URL`: tenant used for TapisUI token handoff. Default `https://icicleai.tapis.io`.
   - `HARP_PORTAL_ORIGINS`: exact comma-separated TapisUI origins allowed to frame HARP and hand off a token.
     When unset, framing remains disabled.
   - `HARP_SESSION_SAME_SITE`: session-cookie policy (`strict`, `lax` or `none`). Use `none` for the hosted iframe.

   To deploy this server as an ICICLE Tapis Pod, including its persistent volume and TapisUI authentication
   handshake, follow [`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md).

## Using the UI

Open `https://<server-hostname>:8443/` (or `http://localhost:8000` with `scripts/run_local.sh`). The whole UI is one
page, `profiling.html` (repository root), with three main tabs, each with its own steps:

| Main tab | Sub-tabs |
|---|---|
| **HARP Generate** | 1 Configure: pick a TAPIS app ("From the TAPIS app" shows what comes from it: container, command, work folder, where its parameters come from, its job defaults, and that output goes to `/TapisOutput`), set up a sweep (run type, repetitions, timeout, single or list values per parameter), tick systems and queues and open each to set its hardware configurations (cores, memory, max minutes, within the queue's TAPIS limits), and enter each system's **account** (allocation, e.g. `-A PAS2271`); add the sweep to the plan. 2 Review & submit: the server checks every sweep against TAPIS and shows what each job asks for. **Results location**: where TAPIS copies each job's output (the job's archive location) and the merged CSV goes; it is filled in from your last sweep, or on OSC `/fs/scratch/<project>/<user>/harp_runs` from the account. Optionally **copy the results to another location**: when the sweep finishes, the server copies its whole folder there with a TAPIS Files transfer task (no job and no allocation account, just your TAPIS login on both systems and write permission). Confirm and submit (all or nothing). 3 Profiled data: per app, every execution with its parameters, hardware and time, pooled across sweeps; medians by run type, hardware and parameter; CSV export. 4 Jobs: every TAPIS job, profiling and build, with its type, hardware and runs done; cancel a sweep. |
| **HARP Build** | 1 Training data: pick the app and the sweeps to learn from (data checks folded away). 2 Models & where: models and training sets, where the build runs (a TAPIS system as a job of the HARP build app, or this computer) and where the models are saved. 3 Trained models: every build with its best model and scores. |
| **HARP Estimate** | 1 Configure: pick an app, give one value per parameter (one run), tick the queues and cores it would get, add it to the estimate list (the model's independent examples). 2 Select model: per app, its trained models best first; the best is preselected. 3 Estimates: every entry with its model. Computing the estimates comes next. |

There is no header and no log-out button: the login screen comes back when the TAPIS session expires.

The **?** buttons explain the terms: SD (scaled-down), FS (full-scale) and test_data runs; sweeps and campaigns (one
submitted sweep is one campaign: the server's record of its TAPIS jobs and its results folder); the models; the
training sets; where a build runs; how models are scored.

**Each user sees only their own work.** Sweeps, jobs, profiled data and builds belong to the TAPIS user *and*
tenant that created them (`alice@icicleai.tapis.io`); everything is read through that user's own TAPIS token, and the
plan and allocations the page keeps in the browser are kept per user too.

For direct, standalone use, paste a current TAPIS access token (JWT) for your tenant. HARP validates it with TAPIS,
keeps it on the server, immediately clears the form, and gives the browser only a session cookie that JavaScript
cannot read. HARP does not accept TAPIS usernames or passwords. When the token expires, running sweeps pause
(`WAITING_FOR_LOGIN`) and resume as soon as you provide a fresh token.

When HARP is opened inside the ICICLE TapisUI, there is no second login form: the iframe requests the access token
from its exact parent origin with `postMessage`, the server validates it through `tapipy`, and then creates the same
HttpOnly session. The token is never put in the iframe URL or browser storage. The portal handshake runs before the
fallback form is displayed, so the token screen normally never appears inside TapisUI.

**Runs done while a job runs.** The job runner rewrites `harp_progress.json` (runs done, failed, total,
current run) in the job's output folder after every run. While a job is RUNNING, the server asks TAPIS for the
job's `execSystemOutputDir` (`getJob`) and reads that file through TAPIS Files on the execution system. When the
job ends it reads the archived `harp_job_summary.json` for the final count. The runner also rewrites
`harp_profile.csv` after every run, so runs that finished are kept even if the job hits its time limit.

### Build an estimator (the build phase, from the Profiled data tab)

1. **Sweeps to learn from.** Tick the app's sweeps. Training needs SD, FS and test_data runs (at least 2, 4 and 1).
   The card says whether there is enough; **Data checks** shows how the data was cleaned: the server writes the
   sweeps' rows in the format the pipeline reads (`run_config, run_type, sys_*, run_<param>, walltime`), adds what each
   job was given (`sys_alloc_cores`, `sys_alloc_mem_mb`), turns true/false into 1/0, and leaves out runs without a time
   and columns not filled in every run. **Download training CSV** gives you the file.
2. **Models to build.** Any of LR (linear regression), NN (neural network) and DTR (decision tree), trained on any of
   SD only, SD+25FS, SD+50FS, SD+75FS. Each comes padded and unpadded.
3. **Where.** Run the build as a **TAPIS job** of the HARP build app on a system/queue you pick (1 node, 4 cores,
   up to 60 minutes, capped by the queue; your allocation from Review is used), or on **this computer**. Pick the
   TAPIS folder for the models.

Either way `job_runner/harp_build_runner.py` runs the pipeline's own build modules (`pipeline/modules/pipeline.py`:
`data_preprocessor` = outliers, scaling, PCA; `model_trainer`), and the results land in
`<folder>/builds/<app>_<timestamp>/`: the training CSV, `full_dataset_pca.csv`, `model_commons.csv` (every score),
`models/<model>_<training set>_<padded yes/no>_<time>.pkl|.h5` and `harp_build_summary.json`. As a TAPIS job the
server stages the training CSV as a file input (`<folder>/builds/.../input/`), TAPIS archives the job's output folder
there, and the job shows in **Jobs** as a build job. **Trained models** lists each build with its best model and
scores (average error and how often it predicts too low, on the test_data runs).

**The build app.** `DockerFiles/Dockerfile_HARP_Build` (pipeline + runner, pandas < 3, scikit-learn, TensorFlow CPU)
is built and pushed by the GitHub workflow as `ghcr.io/<owner>/harp-build:1.0.0`. Register it with
`Notebooks/Create_HARP_Sweep_App_TAPIS.ipynb` and `APP = "build"`; its notes carry `role: "build"`, which is how the
server finds it (it is not listed as an app to profile). For builds on this computer the server needs
`requirements-build.txt`; `scripts/run_local.sh` installs it.

A plan looks like:

```json
{"storage": {"system_id": "pitzer", "path": "/fs/scratch/PAS2271/harp_runs"},
 "allocations": {"pitzer": "-A PAS2271"},
 "sweeps": [{"app_id": "harp-sweep-euler", "name": "sd", "run_type": "SD", "repetitions": 3, "timeout_min": 20,
             "params": {"method": ["pow", "factorial"], "n": ["10", "100"]},
             "targets": [{"system_id": "pitzer", "queue": "serial"},
                         {"system_id": "pitzer", "queue": "serial", "cores": 8}]}]}
```
Leave `cores`, `memory_mb` or `max_minutes` out to use the defaults from the queue.

`DEMO/ui/` has an offline copy of the page with sample data (it mirrors these rules in JavaScript).

## Tests

```bash
cd harp_server && python3 -m pytest -q tests
```
The tests use an in-memory fake of TAPIS (`tests/fake_tapis.py`). The job runner is tested by
really running the Euler example.
